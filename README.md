The backend is over at Render : https://sum-server-34x5.onrender.com/  
You can perform a request like: https://sum-server-34x5.onrender.com/sum?a=34&b=34 and this will return the sum in response.

* IMPORTANT: Render, the place where I've hosted the backend of this projects make's the backend inactive once no one accesses it for long time period like 15min or so, so it takes at least 15 sec to restart the service and that's why you will feel a little delay at first and once the services start everything will be fine.
